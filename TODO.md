# Priority

- [ ] Page design
- [x] Find API to fetch all cities throughout the world (ninja api)
- [x] Make a form with autocomplete for cities based on API calls (see above)
- [ ] **use listeners on options to preload data on click or enter**
**!! warning !! eventlistener on datalist.option does not work. It is not intended to work. Use a parser on input or use a ul.li equivalent or ignore cases like Namur city and Namur county (consider them duplicate)**
- [ ] Stock data fetched from the city API (ex: global variable)
- [ ] Make a unique identifier for each options of the dalalist
- [ ] Make a submit button who calls an(other) API to fetch weather for the chosen city
- [ ] Display the min and max temperature for the 5 next days (including today)

# Optional

- [ ] Cache city
- [ ] Make a city comparison tool
- [ ] Use an [API](https://unsplash.com/) to display the city
- [ ] Make a graph of temperature ([Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/))
